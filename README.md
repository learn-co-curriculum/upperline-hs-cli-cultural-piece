To install on Mac, enter:

### Get your fortune
To install on Mac, enter:
```bash
brew install fortune
```
or on Linux:

apt-get install fortune

### Get your fortune from a cow
If you already have fortune and cowsay installed, then you can use piping to get your fortune straight from the cow's mouth like so:
```bash
fortune | cowsay
```
(You can learn more about piping [here] (http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex15.html).)

Even more command line magic can be found [here](http://www.tecmint.com/20-funny-commands-of-linux-or-linux-is-fun-in-terminal/). Just make sure to use `brew install` instead of `apt-get` if you're on a Mac.
