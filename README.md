```bash
fortune | cowsay
```
(You can learn more about piping [here] (http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex15.html).)

Even more command line magic can be found [here](http://www.tecmint.com/20-funny-commands-of-linux-or-linux-is-fun-in-terminal/). Just make sure to use `brew install` instead of `apt-get` if you're on a Mac.
